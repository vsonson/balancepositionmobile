<label text="Collection of your Information" textWrap="true" style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 15;margin-top: 10;margin-bottom: 10;"></label>
 
 <label text="Balance Position collects various information and data including information that personally identifies you, such as your email address and name, as well as other information that you provide to us or that you include in any information that you submit (together, your “Personal Information”). Your decision to provide Personal Information is voluntary. If, however, you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Sites.
 
Balance Position keeps track of how Users access and use the Sites and pages our customers visit within Balance Position (“Usage Data”).  For example, we may automatically collect information on the device you use and your location, the type of web browser you use, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, the functions you utilize, the time and duration of your visits, crash logs and other information relating to your use of the Sites. We use this information for business purposes such as to analyze trends, administer the Sites, troubleshoot any user problems, and enhance and update the Sites. 
 
When you or others provide, or we collect, information, or carry information between users, we may process and store such data and other related information (“Activity Data”) in order to provide the Sites and related services to you. Some Activity Data may be retained or not completely deleted. Accordingly, we cannot and do not guarantee that the Activity Data will be completely deleted, and therefore any Activity Data that you send or allow to be accessed is sent or provided at your own risk." textWrap="true"></label>
 
<label text="Use of your Personal Information" textWrap="true" style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 15;margin-top: 10;margin-bottom: 10;"></label> 
 
<label text="Balance Position collects and uses your Personal Information, Usage Data and Activity Data (together, the “Data”) to operate the Balance Position website and deliver the services you have requested. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Balance Position does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists or Personal Information to third parties. In addition, Balance Position may share Data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, payment processing, or other activities related to Balance Position’s business. All such third parties are prohibited from using your Personal Information except to provide these services to Balance Position, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In addition, we may disclose Data to other parties for research, general marketing administration, or other purposes. 
 
Balance Position does not use or disclose particularly sensitive Personal Information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
 
Balance Position may also disclose your Personal Information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Balance Position or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Balance Position; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Balance Position, third parties or the public.
 
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners. If Balance Position is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of substantially all of its assets, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information and give affected users notice before Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
 
In addition, any third party that you permit to sign in under your user name may have full access to all of the information in your account including Personal Information as well as the ability to add, distribute, download and edit the same. All Users are responsible for monitoring their account content.  Please note that you, and not Balance Position, are responsible for maintaining and protecting all account content. We may disclose to third parties that you are a User as well in order to connect Users to third parties and allow them to gather and share information." textWrap="true"></label> 
 
<label text="Use of Cookies; Do Not Track" textWrap="true" style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 15;margin-top: 10;margin-bottom: 10;"></label>  
<label text="The Balance Position website uses cookies to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
 
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with Balance Position services, a cookie helps Balance Position to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your Personal Information. When you return to the same Balance Position website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Balance Position features you customized.
 
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Balance Position services or websites you visit.
 
Additionally, your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Sites do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we will collect information about your online activity while you are using our Sites. We do not collect online activity after you leave our Sites." textWrap="true"></label>
 
<label text="Security of your Personal Information" textWrap="true" style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 15;margin-top: 10;margin-bottom: 10;"></label>

Balance Position maintains the Personal Information you provide in a controlled environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When we transmit Personal Information to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Regardless of our efforts, no data transmission over the Internet or other network, including any of the Sites, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you or any User transmits on or through the Sites, and any information you transmit is sent at your own risk." textWrap="true"></label>
